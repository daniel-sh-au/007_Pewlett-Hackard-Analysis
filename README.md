# Module 7: Employee Database with SQL

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose
To prepare for the retirement of baby boomers at Pewlett Hackard, an analysis was performed to determine the number of retiring employees by title and to identify the employees eligible for the mentorship program which will assist in the transition. 

### Resources
* pgAdmin, PostgreSQL
* Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): [EmployeeDB.png](https://github.com/daniel-sh-au/UofT_DataBC_Module07_Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Queries/EmployeeDB.png)
* Challenge Code: [Employee_Database_Challenge.sql](https://github.com/daniel-sh-au/UofT_DataBC_Module07_Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Queries/Employee_Database_Challenge.sql)
* Results: [retirement_titles.csv](https://github.com/daniel-sh-au/UofT_DataBC_Module07_Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/retirement_titles.csv), [unique_titles.csv](https://github.com/daniel-sh-au/UofT_DataBC_Module07_Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/unique_titles.csv), [retiring_titles.csv](https://github.com/daniel-sh-au/UofT_DataBC_Module07_Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.csv), [mentorship_eligibility.csv](https://github.com/daniel-sh-au/UofT_DataBC_Module07_Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)

## Results
The table below is a modified version of retiring_title.csv to include the percentage of employees retiring in each title. 

| Current Employees Titles | Retiring Employees Titles|
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| ![current_employees_titles_with_percentage.png]() | ![retiring_titles_with_percentage.png]()

* In the table, we can see that the majority of those retiring are in senior positions, specifically Senior Engineer (35.77%) and Senior Staff (34.40%). 
* retiring titles png, few managers

## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
